# RobotFaceMaker  
Activity sourced from replit's curriculum by Toni Scullion.  
1. Comment out or delete lines in index.html until you are left with only the elements you want to use for your robot.  
2. Edit their width, position, top, and left properties in style.css to arrange them how you want!

If you finish early: 
- Find a background image for your robot face online. Add it to your webpage and position it behind the face.
- Wrap all the images in a <div> tag. Style the div to have a fixed position in the middle of the page.
- Make another face or find more accessories online!
